    * python

User management
===============

Accounts are created for all userids listed in `admin_users`
(see `group_vars/tfc_servers.yml`). These accounts don't have usable
passwords.

An account is created for tfc_prod. The tfc_prod_id keypair is
installed as tfc_prod's `id_rsa`.

All *_mortal.keys files are transferred to the corresponding user's
.ssh/authorised_keys files.

All *_mortal.keys are concatenated and transferred to
~tfc_prod/.ssh/authorised_keys

All *_priv.keys are concatenated and transferred to
~root/.ssh/authorised_keys
